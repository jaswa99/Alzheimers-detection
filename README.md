Alzheimer's Disease Classification 
This project focuses on classifying brain MRI images from the OASIS dataset into four distinct stages of Alzheimer's disease. A custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a parallel-branch architecture is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to achieve high-accuracy classification.

The model successfully classifies images with an overall test accuracy of 98.07%.

üìã Project Overview
Problem: Multi-class classification of Alzheimer's disease stages.

Dataset: OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) MRI images.

Model: A custom-built CNN with parallel processing branches.

Frameworks: TensorFlow (Keras), Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The project uses the OASIS dataset, which is organized into four classes:

Non Demented

Very Mild Dementia

Mild Dementia

Moderate Dementia

The dataset is split into three sets using a custom script:

Training: 70%

Validation: 15%

Testing: 15%

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
Data Preparation: A custom function (prepare_data) automatically splits the raw images from /kaggle/input/imagesoasis/Data into training, validation, and testing directories.

Data Loading: ImageDataGenerator is used to load the images from their directories.

Images are resized to 224x224 pixels.

Pixel values are normalized by rescaling (dividing by 255).

Class Imbalance Handling: The dataset is imbalanced. To address this, class_weight="balanced" is calculated using sklearn.utils.class_weight and passed to the model during training. This gives more weight to under-represented classes like "Moderate Dementia."

Model Architecture: A custom CNN is built using the Keras Functional API. The architecture consists of:

Block 1: Two Conv2D layers (128 filters) followed by MaxPooling2D.

Block 2: Two Conv2D layers (256 filters) followed by MaxPooling2D.

Parallel Branches: The output from Block 2 is fed into two parallel branches, each containing two Conv2D layers (64 filters).

Concatenation: The feature maps from the parallel branches are concatenated.

Classifier Head: A Flatten layer followed by a Dense layer (64 units, ReLU) and the final Dense output layer (4 units, softmax) for classification.

Training:

Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 1e-4)

Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy

The model was trained for 4 epochs.

Evaluation: The trained model (driver_model.h5) is evaluated on the unseen test set to measure its performance.

üìä Results
The model achieves excellent performance on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between the different stages of dementia.

Final Test Accuracy: 98.07% Final Test Loss: 0.0620
